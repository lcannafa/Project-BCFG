# Project-BCFG
The scope of this project is to achieve image prediction through the implementation of various numerical methods like regresion and interpolation

# Authors
We are Pablo Bernal Moreno, Lorenzo Cannafarina Carrizosa, Diego Andres Giraldo Gomez and Marco Antonio Franco Montoya, all of us are students from EAFIT University

# Contributors
We are working under the supervision of professor Francisco Jose Correa Zabala and with the help of past students from Analisis Numerico (their papers will be used as reference and will be in a folder with the name of "Papers")

# BackUp plan
Even though we are a capable team, things dont always go the way we planned, so we must have a contingency plan, this will be the creation of a aplication with the methods that we have seen in the course Analisis Numerico (the methods will be in a folder called "Backup_Plan")
